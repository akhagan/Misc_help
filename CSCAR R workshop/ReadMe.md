## Workshop Project folder

This folder contains an RStudio project. You have access to several things:

All data files used in the notes.

The 'purled' code from the notes.

Exercises in both R Markdown and in an interactive version.


### A note about the data

Some are `.RData` files, while others might be raw `.csv`.  The former require `load('')`, while the latter can be read with `read.csv('')` or `readr::read_csv('')`.

### A note about the code

The code is purled from the document automatically without any addtional cleaning.  You will see both code plus commented chunk titles, as well as section headers.


### A note about the exercises

To begin with, it would be better to simply read the notes and try for yourself in your own R script or R Markdown file.

The R Markdown file actually contains solutions, so is not very useful if you want to learn.

To use the interactive version:

  - You must install the `learnr` package
  - Open the `exercises_interactive.Rmd`
  - Click `Run Document`
