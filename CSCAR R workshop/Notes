Data Analysis w. R workshop: 2018/02/21

- slides available at: m-clark.github.io

- One of the main points of an R project is that it sets your working directory for you. 

- two main types of vectors: lists & atomic
  - all elements of an atomic vector are the same type (e.g., logical, numeric)
  - matrix requires that all vecotrs be of the same data type (e.g., numeric)
  - lists can take any type of element
  
- often treat dataframes as a matrix, but they are actually lists b/c each column can be a different type
- possible to have row names as an identifier but it's better to have an id column b/c some packages will strip row names
- Data Structure exercises

- [] grabs a slice of elements/columns
-[[]] grab specific element/column (same as $)
- @, similar to $ but used for s4 objects
